# Comparing pymysql and sqlalchemy

## Pymysql:

- A low level library specifically designed for interacting with MySQL databases. It provides a direct way to execute SQL queries and manage database connections.

- Requires you to write SQL queries explicitly for various database operations, such as inserting, updating, and querying data.

- Basic Connection Management: Connection management, including opening, closing, and handling exceptions, is typically done manually in pymysql.

- Lack of Object-Relational Mapping: Pymysql does not provide any object-relational mapping (ORM) features. You have to write SQL queries explicitly for various database operations, such as inserting, updating, and querying data.

- Lack of Data Validation: Pymysql does not provide any data validation features. You have to validate the data manually before inserting it into the database.

- Lack of Security Features: Pymysql does not provide any security features. You have to sanitize the data manually before inserting it into the database.

- Perfomance-Centric: If you need fine-grained control over SQL queries and performance optimization, pymysql is a suitable choice.


## SqlAlchemy:

- SQLAlchemy is a high-level Python library that offers both an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system and a SQL Expression Language. It abstracts database operations and provides an intuitive Pythonic way to interact with databases.

- SQLAlchemy abstracts SQL queries and operations, allowing you to work with Python classes and objects instead of raw SQL queries. It offers a more intuitive and readable approach to database manipulation.

- SQLAlchemy handles connection pooling and transaction management automatically, simplifying database interaction.

- SQLAlchemy is not limited to MySQL but supports a variety of relational database systems, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.

- SQLAlchemy ensures data integrity through transactions and offers cross-database compatibility. You can switch between database systems without major code changes.

## Use Cases:

- If you need fine-grained control over SQL queries and performance optimization, pymysql is a suitable choice.

- If you want to work with Python classes and objects instead of raw SQL queries, SQLAlchemy is a suitable choice.

- If you want to work with multiple database systems, and/or ensure data integrity through transactions, SQLAlchemy is a suitable choice.


## Conclusion:

- Both pymysql and SQLAlchemy are great libraries for interacting with MySQL databases. They have their own strengths and weaknesses. You should choose the one that best suits your needs.
