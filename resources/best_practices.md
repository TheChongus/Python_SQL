# Best Practices for Database Intereaactions

1. Use an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) like SqlAlchemy.
    Utilizing Object Relational Mapping libraries like SQLAlchemy to abstract away raw SQL queries is a great way to simplify your code and make it more readable. It also makes it easier to switch between different database engines, like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

'#sqlalchemy ORM Example
user = User(username='john_doe', email='john@email.com')
session.add(user)
session.commit()
'

2. Prepared Statements:
    Prefer prepared statements or parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection. Prepared statements are also faster than executing raw SQL queries. 

'#pymysql Prepared Statement Example

Use parametrized queries to prevent SQL injection:
username = 'john_doe'
email = 'john@example.com'

sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (%s, %s)"

with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(sql, (username, email))
    conn.commit()

conn.close()
'

3. Use connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections.
    Connection pooling is a technique used to improve performance in applications with dynamic database-driven content. Opening and closing database connections for each user request, especially when the database is on a separate server, can be costly. Connection pooling allows you to reuse existing connections instead of creating new ones, which can significantly improve performance.

'#pymysql Connection Pooling Example
from pymysql import pool

#Use connection pooling
dbconfig = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "mydb",
}
connection_pool = pool.SimpleConnectionPool(**dbconfig, pool_size=5)

#Obtain and release connections as needed
conn = connection_pool.get_connection()

#Perform database operations
connection_pool.put_connection(conn)

#Close the connection pool when finished
connection_pool.close()
'

'#sqlalchemy Connection Pooling Example
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

#Create a connection pool
engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/mydb', pool_size=5, max_overflow=0)
'
